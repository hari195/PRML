# Initilaize 2 means, sigma, and weights
# Import data from file
# Assign constants like no. of samples, no. of features.
# Compute initial Expectation with the given values, and assign each data point to either of the class
# Recompute 6 paramters.
# Check for convergence
# Repeat until convergence
